          <h2>04 Fabruary 2022</h2>
          <p>
            One night in December 2011, a bear came into the city of Vancouver
            in Canada. It walked through the city streets past houses, shops and
            offices. Then it found some food in bins outside a restaurant and
            started eating. In the morning, someone saw the bear and called the
            police. The police came with a vet from the city zoo. They put the
            bear in a lorry and took it to the mountains outside the city.
            Luckily, the bear was safe. But what happens in other countries when
            big animals come into cities? In Vancouver it is unusual to see a
            bear, but in some cities you can see big animals on the city streets
            every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Big animals usually come into cities to find food. In Cape Town in
            South Africa baboons come into the city when they are hungry. They
            go into gardens and eat fruit from trees. They even go into houses
            and take food from cupboards and fridges! Baboons are strong animals
            and they can scare people. But the city can be dangerous for baboons
            too. Sometimes, cars and buses kill baboons in accidents. Human food
            is very bad for the baboonsâ€™ teeth because it has a lot of sugar.
            Now, there are Baboon Monitors working in Cape Town. Their job is to
            find baboons in the city and return them to the countryside.
